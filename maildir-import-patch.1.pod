=head1 NAME

maildir-import-patch - import a git patch series into a maildir

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<maildir-import-patch> I<MAILDIR> [I<git-format-patch(1) args>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<maildir-import-patch> generates a patch series using
git-format-patch(1), and then imports the series into a maildir as an
e-mail thread, one message per patch.

This is useful for providing inline feedback on a branch by e-mail,
when the submitter did not use git-send-email(1).

=head1 EXAMPLE

Suppose that Bob uses git-request-pull(1) to ask you to review and
merge his branch 'feature'.  You add Bob's repository as a remote
called 'bob', check out the bob/feature branch locally, look at the
commits and run some tests.  Now you'd like to provide inline feedback
on Bob's changes, indicating which parts you think are ready to merge
and which parts need more work.  So you type

=over 4

    % maildir-import-patch ~/Maildir/patches master..bob/feature

=back

Over in your MUA, you can then reply to each e-mail in the new thread
generated by B<maildir-import-patch>, providing line-by-line feedback
on Bob's work.

=head1 GIT CONFIGURATION KEYS

=over 4

=item B<mailscripts.project-shortname>

of generated patches, like this: "[PATCH shortname imported]".  If
unset, defaults to the name of the root directory of the repository.

Ignored if any I<--subject-prefix> option is present in the
arguments to be passed on to git-format-patch(1).
